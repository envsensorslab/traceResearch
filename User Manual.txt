There are 3 files:
SetupMode
RTC_quicktime
OperationMode

The first file to run is the Setup Mode. 
- Resets EEPROM to the values in the config file and the sample data table. Basically starts the code from scatch

The second file to run is the RTC_quicktime.
- A minimal sized file to reduce the time from file compilation and file execution to allow a more accuratly set RTC

The third file to run is the OperationMode.
- Actually conducts the sampling and reading of the sensors


A. Setup Mode
1. Before running the setup mode correctly set the configuration variables in the configuration file in the SD card. The configuraiton file is 
called configFl.txt. These values affect the number of syringes being used, which syringe to start on, the delays etc
	- In regards to the system start time, follow the note below regarding timezones
2. Set the sample data table values in the sampleTB.csv file. 
	- Make sure to follow the csv format that is required. 
	- IMPORTANT(time zone issues):
		- The RTC thinks it is in GMT time. Therefore, when the aurdino asks the RTC for the current time, then it will return the GMT time
			for the compiled time. Therefore, for the system start time and the syringe start times. Follow my example.
Used this website (or any epoch time): https://www.epochconverter.com/
In the boxes that have the Mon, Day, Tr, Hr, Min, Sec put the time you want to start sampling from. Then click Human date to Timestamp.
After, that copy the Epoch timestamp as the start time. 

Example:
If the system start time should be (In Eastern Standard Time):
Wed, 01 Mar 2017 12:35:34 GMT (3/1/2017 12:35:34)
then the Epoch time should be
1488371734.

The reason why this is happening is because even though the compile time is in the local time, say 3:40pm. The RTC thinks it is receiving the GMT,
time and therefore it believes that it is being passed the GMT time of 3:40pm. 

3. Set the depths on the second column of the sampleTB.csv file in meters

4. Run the SetupMode and it will either load all the syringes or if there are more than 100 syringes then it will load the first 100 syringes

B. RTC_Quicktime
1. There is nothing to configure, just run this file

C. Operation Mode
Operation Mode

When system starts, will wait for system start time to be reached. 

Runs Operation Mode and iterates syringes one at a time. 

State 1- Loads current syringe information to memory

State 2- Waits for syringe start time to be reached, polls sensor for pressure value

State 3- Logs data and increments syringe

Logs data into DATA.txt
