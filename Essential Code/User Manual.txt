There are 2 files:
SetupMode
OperationMode

The first file to run is the Setup Mode. 
- Resets EEPROM to the values in the config file and the sample data table. Basically starts the code from scatch

The second file to run is the OperationMode.
- Actually conducts the sampling and reading of the sensors

A. Setup Mode
1. Open both Macro template files found in the github repo in the Essential Code directory. Fill out all the required information and then click verify data. 
Fix and errors and when they are all set, export the data right to the SD card.
Note: The time should also be in the local time of where the system will be used.

2. Run the SetupMode and it will either load all the syringes or if there are more than 100 syringes then it will load the first 100 syringes

B. Operation Mode
Operation Mode

When system starts, will wait for system start time to be reached. 

Runs Operation Mode and iterates syringes one at a time. 

State 1- Loads current syringe information to memory

State 2- Waits for syringe start time to be reached, polls sensor for pressure value

State 3- Logs data and increments syringe

Logs data into DATA.txt


To Run Program:
1. Use the Macro Excel templates and load the files to the uSD card (Step A1)
2. Run SetupMode 
3. Load the Operation Mode sketch.
	3a. First run the Operation Mode with PC_comms enabled to verify that the system is working. Make sure that the system is sleeping for the correct amount of time
	3b. Then reload the code but with PC_comms off. While step 3 is optional, it is recommended to verify working code. Running the system with PC
	comms off is important because certain aspects like the syringe iteration go from a second or 2 to execute to less than 100ms.
